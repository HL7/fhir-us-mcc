This profile constrains [US Core DocumentReference](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-documentreference.html) to reference, query for and retrieve Personal Advance Care Plans that exist for a patient. In addition to the requirements set forth in US Core DocumentReference it constrains documentType codableConcept to the LOINC document code to 81334-5 "Patient Personal advance care plan". The current FHIR specifications identifying a patient's advance directives or a patient's personal advance is immature and changing and unimplemented in systems. Therefore, at this time, the MCC eCare Plan seeks to find [CDA based Personal Advance Care Plans](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=434) that are comparatively widely implemented in systems and contain vital end of life patient requests and within which may point to actual Medical Order for Life-Sustaining Treatments (MOLST) or Physician Order for Life-Sustaining Treatments (POLST) .

No additional value sets were defined for use in this profile beyond the US Core Document Reference Profile.
