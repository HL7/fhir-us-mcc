# Introduction
The MCC eCare Plan Implementation Guide provides a few detailed use cases to help clarify the technically complicated concept of a Care Plan. From a human cognitve perpspective it is easy to conceptualize the concept of a patient problem or health concern and the need to identify goals, and the methods needed to achieve those goals, such as appropriate medications, procedures, activities and education, followed by the need to re-evaluate, and assess progress towards the goal. The provider understands the disease process associated with the condition. In addition, a care provider understands the health care system services and the services outside the health care system that are needed to treat a patient and achieve a greater level of wellness. However, this can be a time consuming process.

A dynamic Care Plan's lofty goal intends to replicate that as much as possible to provide machine assisted care coordination. This is a daunting task.

Use cases can provide an understanding of business needs of a Care Plan. The intention is to ensure a wide and solid understanding of the need for the technical solutions defined in the implmentation guide with the use of actors and user personas.  A use case is a sequence of actions that provide a measurable value to an actor. The use cases describe ways in which a real-world actor interacts with the systems.

The following pages provide the use case details.

# Use Case Scope
* Identify use cases to support the documentation and exchange of Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC) eCare Plan data within electronic health record (EHR) systems and other healthcare technology systems.
* Identify workflow processes required to support basic care coordination requirements such as processes defined in the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) dynamic care planning (DCP) technical profile <make in to link>.
* Note: The current FHIR IG will not define consent and subscription. However, those will be considered for future use.
