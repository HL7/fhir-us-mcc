The [US Core Service Requst](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-servicerequest) sets minimum expectations for the ServiceRequest resource to record, search, and fetch service requests associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set forth in US Core Service Requst this derived profile is designed to add requirements to the following elements:
* MCCServiceRequest.extension:resource-pertainsToGoal (Must Support) to encourage linking to the goal the service request hopes to facilitate and/or to encourage systems to be able to receive and understand a goal linkage if present.

No additional value sets were defined for use in this profile beyond the the value set bindings in the US Core Procedure profile, but please see the [MCC Procedure and Service Request Value Set](mcc_procedure_and_service_request_value_sets.html) library page for guidance on use of procedure terminology in this guide.
