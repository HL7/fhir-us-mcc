The [US Core Observation SDOH Assessment Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-observation-sdoh-assessment) sets minimum expectations for the Observation Resource to record, search, and fetch SDOH assessment questionaire responses associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set forth in US Core Observation SDOH Assesment Profile this derived profile is designed to add requirements to the following elements:
* MCCObservationSDOHAssessment.extension:resource-pertainsToGoal (Must Support) to encourage linking to the goal the medication hopes to facilitate and/or to encourage systems to be able to receive and understand a goal linkage if present.

See the [MCC Care Plan SDOH Guidance](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-us-mcc/branches/master/mcc_care_plan_sdoh_guidance.html) page for more information when exchanging Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Problems/Health Concerns.

Comments are welcome with respect to the pragmatic use of the "Must Support" rules defined on these elements.
