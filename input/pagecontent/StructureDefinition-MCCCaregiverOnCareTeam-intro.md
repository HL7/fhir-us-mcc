Like clinician provider, a caregiver is an entity defined, in part, by a person (caregiver), a target of care (patient) and a role. This profile provides the ability to define a Caregiver for a specific patient, and provides a referenceable entity that is a Caregiver. Caregiver is not necessarily a formal position, so it does not fall under FHIR Practitioner. It features a requirement for one caregiver as a participant. The purpose is to establish that the RelatedPerson is a caregiver for the indicated patient. Use of this profile allows for explicitly indicating that observations on the caregiver are specific to the position of caregiver for a specific patient. To reiterate, caregivers are not typically considered practitioners with formal professional roles in the care of the patient. However, their participation as the caregiver is a critical function/context to observations about their ability to deliver care to the patient. Again, this profile creates an entity that can be considered to be a Caregiver (caregiver requires a RelatedPerson, the giver, and a Patient, person to whom care is given, to be defined). The [US Core Care Team](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-careteam) sets minimum expectations for the CareTeam resource to record, search, and fetch caregivers associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set forth in US Core CareTeam this derived profile is designed to add requirements to the following elements:

* MCCCareTeam.extension:resource-pertainsToGoal (Must Support) to encourage linking to the goal to facilitate and/or to encourage systems to be able to receive and understand a goal linkage if present.
* MCCCareTeam.participant requires single RelatedPerson (caregiver) and set to must support


Comments are welcome with respect to the pragmatic use of the "Must Support" rules defined on these elements.
