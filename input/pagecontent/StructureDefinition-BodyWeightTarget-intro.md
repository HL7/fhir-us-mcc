The [US Core Goal Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-goal) sets minimum expectations for the Goal resource to record, search, and fetch Goal information associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set in the US Core Goal Profile, in this profile, Goal.target.measure is "Must Support" and is bound to LOINC 29463-7 "Body weight". This LOINC code is the same LOINC code used in the [CIMI Body Weight Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vitals/StructureDefinition/BodyWeight). Goal.expressedBy is also constrained to "Must Support".
