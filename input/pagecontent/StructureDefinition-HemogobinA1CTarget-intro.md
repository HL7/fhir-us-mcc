The [US Core Goal Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-goal) sets minimum expectations for the Goal resource resource to record, search, and fetch Goal information associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set in the US Core Goal Profile, in this profile, Goal.target.measure is "Must Support" and is bound to a hemogobin A1C value set. Goal.expressedBy is also constrained to "Must Support".
