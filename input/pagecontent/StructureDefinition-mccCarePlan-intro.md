In the R5 Care Plan Resource, author has been replaced by custodian, as in R4 the CarePlan author was incorrectly defined as the “responsible party”. The CarePlan.contributor is intended to record who or what added data to the care plan. The custodian extension has been added to the MCC Care Plan to represent the designated responsible party for the care and maintenance of the care plan. It is available for use but is nor required or must support.
We are seeking comments with respect to who or what is the responsible party of a care plan that is dynamically generated with data from different health systems.

A Care Plan is a consensus-driven dynamic plan that represents a patient’s and Care Team Members’ prioritized concerns, goals, and planned interventions. It serves as a blueprint shared by all Care Team Members (including the patient, their caregivers, and providers), to guide the patient’s care. A Care Plan integrates multiple interventions proposed by multiple providers and disciplines for multiple conditions. A Care Plan may represent one or more Care Plans and serves to reconcile and resolve conflicts between the various plans developed for a specific patient by different providers. It supports the following use cases:
 
* Query for patient data across providers and compile into a consolidated care plan representation.
* Encourage capture of and communication of a patient's health concerns and related goals, interventions, and outcomes.
* Gather and aggregate patient data for uses beyond the point of care (e.g. public health, population health, quality measurement, risk adjustment, quality improvement, and research.)
