There are no additional value sets developed for the [MCC Medication Request](StructureDefinition-MCCMedicationRequest.html) profile beyond the [Medication Clinical Drug](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1010.4/expansion) value set bound at Medication.medicationCodableConcept or within a Medication.Reference and other vocabulary bindings as defined in the US Core Profiles that the MCC Procedure and the MCC Service Request Profiles are derived from and the SDOH value sets defined by the Gravity project for Procedures and Service Requests.  Procedure and Service Request encoded concepts are typically interchangeable, but there may be some nuanced differences, and so Gravity has created two similar sets.
