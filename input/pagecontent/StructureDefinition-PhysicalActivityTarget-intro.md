The [US Core Goal Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-goal) sets minimum expectations for the Goal resource resource to record, search, and fetch Goal information associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set in the US Core Goal Profile, in this profile, Goal.target.measure is "Must Support" and is bound to a physical activity target value set. Goal.expressedBy is also constrained to "Must Support". Specifics for each physical activity target goal could be defined through Goal.target.detail. For example, Goal.target.measure could be "Physical activity target moderate exercise" and Goal.target.detail could define "2 hours per day" in an encoded Goal.target.detail.detailQuantity or it could be described with Goal.target.detailString "2 hours per day of weight bearing exercise".
