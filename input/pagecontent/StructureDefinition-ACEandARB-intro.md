The [MedicationRequest](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medicationrequest.html) resource can be used to record a patientâ€™s medication prescription or order. The [US Core Medication Request profile](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-medicationrequest.html) sets minimum expectations for the MedicationRequest resource to record, search, and fetch medications associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets SHALL be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set forth in US Core Medication Request the derived profile is designed to specifically fetch ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and ARBs (Angiotensin II receptor blockers) medication by binding medicationCodableConcept to an ACE and ARB RxNorm Value set.
