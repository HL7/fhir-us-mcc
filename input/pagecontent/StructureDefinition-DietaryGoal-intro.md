The [US Core Goal Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-goal) sets minimum expectations for the Goal resource resource to record, search, and fetch Goal information associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set in the US Core Goal Profile, in this profile, Goal.target.measure is "Must Support" and is bound to a dietary regime  value set. Goal.expressedBy is also constrained to &quot;Must Support&quot;.  The Goal.category is constrained to "Dietary". Specifics for each dietary goal could be defined through Goal.target.detail. For example, Goal.target.measure could be "Decreased Sodium"  and Goal.target.detail could define "Less than 1500 mg per day". This could be represented with a string or in an encoded Goal.target.detail.detailQuantity.
