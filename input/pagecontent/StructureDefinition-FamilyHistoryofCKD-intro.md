This profile sets additional expectations for the [FHIR Family Member History Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcc/StructureDefinition/ChronicKidneyDisease) to record, search, and fetch first degree family members who have or had chronic kidney disease (CKD) conditions. FamilyMemberHistory.condition is set to "Must Support" and FamilyMemberHistory.condition.code is bound to a chronic kidney disease value set. FamilyMemberHistory.relationship is bound to a first degree family member value set which is a subset of the [V3 Family Member Value set](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/familymemberhistory.html).
