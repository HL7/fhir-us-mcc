The [US Core Procedure profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-procedure) sets minimum expectations for the Procedure resource to record, search, and fetch procedures associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set in the US Core Procedure profile, procedureCode is bound to a kidney biopsy procedure value set. The intent of this profile is to gain awareness or record a kidney biopsy procedure regardless of whether a diagnostic report is found or recorded. However, it is most valuable to also have the results of the kidney biopsy. Therefore, Procedure.report is set to “Must Support”.
