The [US Core Procedure profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-procedure) sets minimum expectations for the Procedure resource to record, search, and fetch procedures associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set in the US Core Procedure profile, procedureCode is bound to a Renal Disease Transplant Procedure value set.
