The [MedicationRequest](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medicationrequest.html) resource can be used to record a patientâ€™s medication prescription or order. The [US Core Medication Request profile](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-medicationrequest.html) sets minimum expectations for the MedicationRequest resource to record, search, and fetch medications associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets SHALL be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set forth in US Core Medication Request the derived profile is designed to specifically fetch Phosphate Binder medications by binding medicationCodableConcept to a Phosphate Binder RxNorm Value set.
