This profile constrains the [US Core Diagnistic Report - Lab](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-lab) to a Complete Blood Count (CBC) Panel. The US Core Diagnostic Report - Lab profile sets minimum expectations to record, search, and fetch panel laboratory results associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using the profile. This profile add additional constraints by binding DiagnosticReport.code, with an *example* binding, to a common CBC LOINC code "58410-2", "CBC panel - Blood by Automated count", and references component US Core compliant Laboratory Result Observation Profiles specified for common CBC resultable components.
