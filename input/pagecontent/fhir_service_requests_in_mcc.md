## Orders and requests using ServiceRequest Resource
Within the FHIR Care Plan, CarePlan.Activity‚Äù is a Backbone element that is the cornerstone for specific care coordination activities. It identifies an action that has occurred or is a planned action to occur as part of the plan. There can be many activities within a care plan, but only one core activity per activity element. The core activity is represented by CarePlan.Activity.reference and as such represents the cornerstone of care coordination activities. Please see diagrams within[## MCC FHIR eCare Plan Profile Design](https://trifolia-fhir.lantanagroup.com/igs/lantana_hapi_r4/MCC-IG/ig_cornerstone_mcc_fhir_ecare_plan_profile_design.html#ig-cornerstone-mcc-fhir-ecare-plan-profile-design) or within [MCC Care Plan profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcc/StructureDefinition/mccCarePlan).

In this draft of the IG, the base [ServiceRequest](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/servicerequest.html#12.14) resource is referenced and not constrained, in order to promote sensitivity in searching for Care Activities rather than specificity to procedures typically associated with CKD. However, within the requests, the resource-pertainsToGoal extension **SHALL** be used and Request.reason **SHALL** be used. This is necessary to support the Care coordination / Care Plan workflow to link Health concerns/Problems and their associated interventions goals and outcomes. Please see discussion within[## MCC FHIR eCare Plan Profile Design](https://trifolia-fhir.lantanagroup.com/igs/lantana_hapi_r4/MCC-IG/ig_cornerstone_mcc_fhir_ecare_plan_profile_design.html#ig-cornerstone-mcc-fhir-ecare-plan-profile-design) or within [MCC Care Plan profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcc/StructureDefinition/mccCarePlan).

Future drafts may create specific profiles testing determines this is necessary.

## Referrals using ServiceRequest Resource
For referrals, the implementation guide also directly uses the the base [ServiceRequest](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/servicerequest.html#12.14) resource. Again, within referrals requests, the resource-pertainsToGoal extension **SHALL** be used and Request.reason **SHALL** be used. This is necessary to support the Care coordination / Care Plan workflow to link Health concerns/Problems and their associated interventions goals and outcomes. Please see discussion within[## MCC FHIR eCare Plan Profile Design](https://trifolia-fhir.lantanagroup.com/igs/lantana_hapi_r4/MCC-IG/ig_cornerstone_mcc_fhir_ecare_plan_profile_design.html#ig-cornerstone-mcc-fhir-ecare-plan-profile-design) or within [MCC Care Plan profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcc/StructureDefinition/mccCarePlan).
In this draft of the IG we do not constrain to specific referral types, but do provide a list of codes suitable for ServiceRequest.code that are presently of interest to patients with CKD.
