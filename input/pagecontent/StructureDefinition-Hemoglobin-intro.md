The [US Core Laboratory Result Observation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-observation-lab) sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search, and fetch laboratory test results associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. In addition to the requirements set in the US Core Laboratory Result Observation Profile, observationCode is bound to a Hemoglobin value set.
