This profile sets additional expectations for the US Core Condition profile to record, search, and fetch cognitive health and impaired memory disorder conditions associated with a patient. These conditions may be derived from assessment scales or questionnaires. The intent of this profile is only to represent the problem, condition or health concern itself and not an assessment scale or questionnaire. In addition to the requirements set in the US Core Condition profile, conditionCode is bound to a cognitive health and impaired memory disorder conditions value set and the Condition.onset and Condition.recordedDate are set to "must support".
