This profile sets additional expectations for the [US Core Condition profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition) to record, search, and fetch condition or diagnosis terms representing chronic kidney disease (CKD) conditions associated with a patient. In addition to the requirements set in the US Core Condition profile, conditionCode is bound to a chronic kidney disease condition or diagnosis value set and the Condition.onset and Condition.recordedDate are set to "must support ''. In addition the profile seeks to record, search, fetch and associate supporting evidence for the diagnosis or state of CKD. While not limiting the possible evidence asserted, the profile explicitly seeks to find and represent evidence of end stage renal disease by looking for assertions of stage 5 chronic kidney disease conditions, evidence the patient is receiving dialysis or has had a kidney transplant. In addition, evidence may be expressed within a lab result profile. CKD relevant lab results may also be expressed elsewhere in the Care Plan. If present, family history of chronic kidney disease may also exist as pertinent information in the evidence element. The profile leverages the "Condition-Due To'' extension defined on the base condition resource, which contains a profile on condition "CKD Type or Cause". The profile allows expression of the kidney disease stage either through a pre-coordinated ICD10 or SNOMED CT code in the "CKD All stages‚Äù profile or through the "Stage" backbone element where post-coordinated stage can be expressed. The MCC IG Draft 1.0 CKD Profile, allows, but does not define post- coordinated staging. If the backbone element where post-coordinated stage can be expressed is used, care must be taken that the condition.code and condition.stage do not conflict.
