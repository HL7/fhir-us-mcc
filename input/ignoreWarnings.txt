# UCUM use of unit less annotation. In this case the annotation is simply for human readability. It is expected to be treated as an integer in machine processing
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {score} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked

# UCUM use of 1.73 m2 is consistent with reporting glomerular filtration rate. It is appropriate in this case.
